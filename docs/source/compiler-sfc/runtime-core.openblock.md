## openBlock() function

Open a block. This must be called before `createBlock`<!-- -->. It cannot be part of `createBlock` because the children of the block are evaluated before `createBlock` itself is called. The generated code typically looks like this:

```js
function render() {
  return (openBlock(),createBlock('div', null, [...]))
}

```
disableTracking is true when creating a v-for fragment block, since a v-for fragment always diffs its children.


<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function openBlock(disableTracking?: boolean): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  disableTracking | boolean |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

void
